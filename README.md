This is a Electron and React boilerplate, based off of paachu's tutorial. (https://medium.com/@impaachu/how-to-build-a-react-based-electron-app-d0f27413f17f)

Use 'yarn start' to run it in development mode, and 'yarn build' to build the distributables.

Special thanks to paachu for the great, yet simple tutorial.
